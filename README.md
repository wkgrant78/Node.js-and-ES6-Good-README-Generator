# Node.js-and-ES6-Good-README-Generator

###
Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the Inquirer package. Review the Good README guide as a reminder of everything that a quality, professional README contains. The application will be invoked with the following command:

node index.js
Because this is a command-line application that won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of your application. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer.

### USER STORE
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional README for a new project

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions

### MINIMUM APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
Functional application.

GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

The generated README includes the following sections:

Title
Description
Table of Contents
Installation
Usage
License
Contributing
Tests
Questions
The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.

### SUBMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS
Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You should include a link to the video in your application's README.md file.

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/.

node_modules is not tracked and uploaded to GitHub. (Hint: It is easy if you create your .gitignore file before installing dependencies with npm.)

Repo MUST include package.json with required dependencies. (Hint: Run npm init when you first setup the project before installing any dependencies.)

Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
